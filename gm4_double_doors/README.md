# Bat Grenades<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

Annoyed by how vanilla handles double doors? Sick of having to interact with both doors when opening them manually? This Data pack makes it so that interacting with one also opens the other door! <!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- When a player interacts with a door that is part of a double door, both doors are opened/closed automatically!
- Only doors which are of the same type and adjacent show this behavior.
- Holding shift whilst interacting disables the auto-opening!
